                    HTML | CSS | Javascript | Python | Django | Bootstrap
                </p>
                <p>
                    My final project on the full-stack developer course at Code Institute required me to build a web
                    application in 7 days. This capstone project was to be completed alone with the guidance of an
                    allocated mentor (4x 1-hour meetings) using all my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and
                    Django. I decided to build the MVP web application for a local tattoo artist “Kit Wagstaff” so that
                    their clients had access to an intuitive appointment booking system instead of booking through
                    Instagram's chat feature. This meant that Kit would have quicker access to the relevant appointment
                    information to help improve their business management and ultimately allow her to spend more time on
                    designs and improving her craft. The web application would also include portfolio, about, terms and
                    conditions, and tattoo care pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took the basic requirements of the website and combined them with Kit's target audience:
                    20-35-year-old female student or professional with an alternative style. They are climate conscious
                    and a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community. The target audience information helped me to create user
                    stories and the subsequent success criteria which dictated the necessary features and their
                    importance. These user stories were made into issues on GitHub and then placed onto the project's
                    Kanban board. I was then ready to move onto the design stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create a product which Kit would be happy to use, the style and feel of the website needed to
                    represent her correctly. I researched them as a person and as an artist. I also asked if they had an
                    idea of what style the website should follow - they provided me with a recently created gift
                    voucher. This provided me with a general style guide and a strong colour palette. I was now ready to
                    create the wireframes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created the wireframes in Adobe XD, concentrating on mobile, tablet, and desktop formats. However,
                    to save time, I created the homepage layout for all three devices and then created the remaining
                    pages in desktop format. Once the designs were approved, I requested a selection of Kit's favourite
                    recent tattoo designs which I edited in Photoshop to reduce their file size and keep the dimensions
                    constant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began the build phase of the project by getting all the files and apps set up in Django. I created
                    and linked my ElephantSQL database, Cloudinary account, and Heroku app to ensure an early
                    deployment. The early deployment allowed me to find issues with the app early on. Once these issues
                    were dealt with, I moved on to creating my model for the booking app, which were based off my
                    initial ERDs. Once these models were migrated, I created my templates and adjusted my views
                    accordingly. I decided to use function-based views as it was a more logical way of including the
                    necessary steps in my code to process booking creations, edits, and deletes. I then created my model
                    for the portfolio gallery along with adjusting the views and the templates. Once the basic
                    functionality was working across the site, I concentrated on styling and eventually adding a small
                    amount of scroll-reveal animation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before submitting the project, I carried out extensive testing on the website's functionality,
                    features, and defensive programming. If you wish to read through the documentation, it can be found
                    on my GitHub repo - links below.
