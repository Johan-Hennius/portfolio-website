                    Becoming a full-stack developer at Code Institute involved taking part in group hackathons. For our
                    first hackathon, we were split into teams of 3 and 4. I was placed into a team of 3 and we were
                    given a
                    brief which asked us to create a static website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for an online coding
                    school in 3 days. We had to create user stories, the website’s wireframe, build the website, track
                    progress using a project board on GitHub, utilised Git for our code management, followed an agile
                    workflow, and adhered to the principles of UX design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project started off with a good old fashioned planning stage. We took our brief and as a group,
                    decided on the business objectives of the product. We then came up with user stories and added them
                    to a backlog in the form of a project board on GitHub. We did this to break our project into
                    bite-sized chunks using our user stories as a guide and created achievable, key milestones. Once we
                    were happy that we had covered everything for the MVP along with some nice-to-have functionality, we
                    moved on to the design stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design stage involved taking our user stories and drawing up the website’s functions
                    accordingly. I decided to use Adobe Illustrator to create the wireframe design. To create a final
                    product that was visually appealing, intuitive, and achievable in the timeframe, I decided to use a
                    minimalist design approach with accent colours on key items. This ensured that we could spend more
                    time on the website’s functionality and responsiveness. After the designs were approved by all team
                    members, we moved on to the build phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the website by first creating a boilerplate template and copied over to each individual
                    page. Each member took one page. We built using a mobile first approach by utilising Bootstrap’s
                    quick column classes to ensure responsiveness was locked in at the start. Once this was complete, we
                    deployed our website and starting squashing bugs. The main bug I faced was to do with the carousel.
                    I wanted to edit the carousel so it would include a more defined caption section – this proved to be
                    tricky as the font and their respective containers did not behave as intended. I fixed this by
                    adjusting the width properties and font sizes with custom media queries. As a group, we would take
                    time to review each other’s pages to speed up the bug hunt and ensure that we had a consistent
                    design throughout the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the project was complete, we took part in a group retrospective. We found that our team worked
                    efficiently due to our constant communication and willingness to help. Our knowledge of CSS and
                    Bootstrap had also increased. The final product did not work completely as intended as certain
                    features did not respond as well to the different breakpoints. However, we did learn how to avoid
                    these issues in future by considering custom breakpoints early on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hackathon was a great experience as it showed us how capable we had become in such a short time.
                    I learnt that communication and planning is key to achieve the intended goals of a project. I left
                    the hackathon feeling inspired to learn more CSS techniques, so I could become an efficient asset to
                    a team while also being able to help future team members with more advanced CSS techniques.
