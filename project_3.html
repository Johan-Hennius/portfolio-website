                    HTML | CSS | Javascript | Python | Django | Bootstrap

                <p>
                    For our third and final hackathon, Code Institute needed us to create a full-stack web application
                    in 3 days using our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django. The class was split into
                    teams, and we got to work. My team's first task was to figure out our product. We decided to build a
                    booking application for a rage room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took this idea and began the project development by figuring out our target audience. Our target
                    audience was a 25-40-year-old professional who needs stress relief. This gave us the necessary
                    information to create our user stories which contained success criteria that helped to dictate our
                    website's features. These user stories were then placed on our project kanban board and organised
                    into levels of urgency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the success criteria in the user stories, I then created the project’s wireframes while other
                    members of the team set up the models, and the project’s development environment. I created the
                    wireframes in Adobe XD, focusing on a simple, high contrast layout. I also used Adobe Photoshop to
                    add a halftone effect to a couple of images for the home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The build stage of the app was difficult but thanks to our effective communication and planning, we
                    were able to get the full functionality of the website complete within the first 2 days. For a
                    customer to book a room, they needed to create an account. Once they had requested a booking, it
                    would be approved by a member of staff. This meant that we had two separate user models. The type of
                    user would dictate what features were available to them in the site’s navigation. Normal users had
                    access to the event list and the booking feature. While the members of staff had access to the event
                    creation and booking approval features. Although we did work on the website’s style during the
                    entire length of the project, once the functionality had been completed, we were able to polish the
                    site as much as possible in the remaining time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the project, we took part in our team retrospective where we agreed that our team had
                    succeeded due to our communication, planning, and clear assignment of roles. If we were to do the
                    project again, we would have allocated some more time to the website’s finished appearance as some
                    pages were left unfinished but as an MVP, it was a success. This project gave us the necessary moral
                    boost before starting our final full-stack capstone projects.
