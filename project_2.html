                    Our second hackathon at Code Institute required us to utilise our knowledge of CSS, HTML, and
                    JavaScript
                    to create an app based on a brief which was given to us by our tutor. The class was split into teams
                    of
                    3 and 4 before receiving our briefs. My team’s brief requested a advanced calculator to be created
                    using
                    image mapping and JavaScript functions. Like our first hackathon, we had to create user stories,
                    wireframes, and the functioning app while utilising Git and GitHub for the project management. We
                    followed an agile workflow and the principles of UX design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As always, we started the project with a planning session where we analysed our brief as a group and
                    created user stories which dictated its functionality. These user stories focused on a person in
                    education who required a calculator to perform advanced equations. We then fed our user stories into
                    our project kanban board and organising the stories into levels of importance.
                </p>

                    As always, we started the project with a planning session where we analysed our brief as a group and
                    created user stories which dictated its functionality. These user stories focused on a person in
                    education who required a calculator to perform advanced equations. We then fed our user stories into
                    our project kanban board and organising the stories into levels of importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then took the user stories and created the wireframes based on the required functionality. These
                    designs were created in Adobe Illustrator because we could export the calculator and use it as the
                    image map for the calculator. The inspiration behind the calculator’s main design was partly from
                    apple’s calculator and other simple designs found on Pinterest. The aim of the calculator was to be
                    clear and have enough room in the display section to show the operands, operator, and sum. While
                    designing the calculator, we decided that another feature of the app was to have multiple skins and
                    a member’s only history and explanation section. The history would store previous sums with basic
                    CRUD functionality and the explanation section would provide brief explanations of certain operators
                    with a link to further information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The build stage was tough. We split the features between us and got to work. To begin with, I was
                    mainly concentrating on the UI. After the UI had been completed, I jumped into the JavaScript code
                    to add some animation, explanations functionality, and try to help figure out the parentheses code.
                    We decided to abandon the parentheses as this required too much work for the time that we had – this
                    became a future function that we would try to Implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the project was complete, we took part in our retrospective where we realised that we had an
                    extremely talented and kind bunch of people in our group. Our communication was great, and we
                    constantly checked in and helped each other if anyone was stuck. Although there was a lot of
                    unfinished functionality due to time constraints, this project increased our working knowledge of
                    JavaScript tenfold. We left feeling confident and inspired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that a hackathon is a great way to not only put your technical skills to the test but it’s
                    a great way to understand how to effectively work as a team in a development environment!
